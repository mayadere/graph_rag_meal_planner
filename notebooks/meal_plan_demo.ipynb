# Meal Plan Demo Jupyter Notebook
# In this notebook, we will demonstrate how to generate a meal plan from recipe data stored in Neo4j.

# Importing necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from neo4j_connector import connect_to_neo4j
from graph_rag_pipeline import generate_meal_plan
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Step 1: Connect to Neo4j Database
# We'll use the `connect_to_neo4j` function to establish a connection to the Neo4j database.
graph = connect_to_neo4j()

# Step 2: Define Meal Plan Constraints and Date Range
# Specify the meal period and date range for the meal plan.
start_date = "02-Dec-2024"
end_date = "15-Dec-2024"

# Meal period (could be 'Breakfast', 'Lunch', 'Dinner')
meal_period = "Breakfast"

# Example dietary constraint: Let's assume we are looking for vegetarian options in the breakfast meal period.
dietary_constraints = {
    "meal_period": meal_period,
    "dietary_restriction": "Vegetarian",  # For simplicity, assume the recipe names contain the dietary info
}

# Step 3: Generate Meal Plan
# Using the `generate_meal_plan` function from the pipeline, we will generate a meal plan for the specified date range.
meal_plan_df = generate_meal_plan(start_date, end_date, graph, dietary_constraints)

# Step 4: Visualize the Meal Plan
# Let's display the first few rows of the meal plan to see the generated recipes.
meal_plan_df.head()

# If the data looks correct, we can plot it or filter it further for more insights.
# For now, we can visualize the meal plan distribution by meal type (e.g., Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner).

# Visualize the distribution of recipes by meal period (optional)
meal_plan_df['MealPeriod'].value_counts().plot(kind='bar', color='skyblue')
plt.title('Distribution of Meal Periods')
plt.xlabel('Meal Period')
plt.ylabel('Number of Recipes')
plt.show()

# Step 5: Filtering Meal Plan Based on Additional Constraints
# Example: Filter for specific categories or ingredients
filtered_meal_plan = meal_plan_df[meal_plan_df['Category'] == "Asian Sauces"]

# Display filtered meal plan
filtered_meal_plan.head()

# Step 6: Save Meal Plan to CSV (optional)
# If you want to save the generated meal plan to a CSV file for further use, you can do so:
meal_plan_df.to_csv('generated_meal_plan.csv', index=False)

print("Meal Plan generation and visualization complete!")
